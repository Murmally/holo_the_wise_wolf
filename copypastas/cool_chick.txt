Why am I always being put in the thot zone? I'm a cool chick, I play video games, I have a thick skin and can hang, I read Jordan Peterson and listen to Joe Rogan . In the end these guys always go after DOUCHEBAG guy friends to hang out with and ignore me. I'm sick of being considered 'femoid' or whatever you call it I'm really tired of all the cute edgy boys completely ignoring me. I don’t want you to be my beta cuck orbiter, I just went to chat with you about IDW philosophy and maybe send you my lewds. MRAs and internet culture have ruined this generation of men. I’m not like other girls! I don’t mind that you are red pilled! Why can’t they see that and just give me a try? You don’t have to be a doomer, I can fix you! You guys have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you guys aren't attracted to me. It's an injustice, a crime, because... I don't know what you don't see in me. I'm the perfect girl and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men friends instead of me, the supreme cool chick.
