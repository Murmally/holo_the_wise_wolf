Did yousa ever be hearin de tragedy of Darth Plagueis de Wise? Meesa thinkin not. It’s not a story dem Jedi would spake. It’s a nutsin Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a mooie Dark Lord of da Sith, so powerful and so wise heesa could be usin da Force to influence de midichlorians tis bein creatin life, okeeday? Hesa had such maxi big knowledge of de dark side that heaa could even keep da ones he cared about from going "boom de gasa"... den crashded da boss's heyblibber... den banished.. De dark side of da Force is a pathway to many biiiiig gooberfish abilities some consider to smell stinkowiff. Hesa became so powerful… da only thing hesa was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, hesa did. Icky icky goo! Unfortunately, hesa taught his apprentice everything hesa tinkin, then his apprentice crunchin' hesa in hesa's sleep. Ironic, mesa hatin' crunchin'. Dat's de last thing mesa want. Better hesa dead there than deader in da Core. Hesa could save other boy-os from death, but not himself. Ye Gods, whatta mesa sayin'?!
