The doomer girl meme is destroying the whole point of doomerism. The doomer isn't a young man without a girlfriend. It's a young man stuck in the modern day, where the morals of the old world he once saw and dreamt of is now ripped away from him, it's about a young man who is inside all of us, it's about a young man being betrayed and rejected by society, a young man who sees his peers make friends and relationships but he is unable to. A young man who needs friends. It is not a young man without a girlfriend. That is normie shit. Normies get depressed about no gf. Normies get depressed about stupid shit like that. The doomer is a young man starved from the love of humanity. We all felt it once, when we were younger and innocent.

Just like there is a Tyler Durden in all, there is a doomer in all of us.
