fuck it imma say it. It’s totally overkill that lego city needs to send an entire helicopter to save one fucking idiot that walked in an unstable bridge. 1 person with even above average swimming skills could save him easily. Not to mention that something like that costs taxpayers tons of money. Fucking incompetent dumbasses. This isn’t even taking into account the construction crew that needs to build the helicopter, which comes in fucking P I E C E S so I can’t imagine just how many gold studs that would cost the poor civilians of lego city. Not to mention that about 85% of the buildings are on fire, like, the firemen must have a fucking crazy job seeing as they need about 16 vehicles just to cover enough ground. All-together I believe that anarchy would be a far better legal system when compared to lego city’s current pathetic attempt at management.
