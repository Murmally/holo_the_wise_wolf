Wow, that was fucking hilarious. I am laughing so hard that I can feel all my organs raising up to my throat like projectiles just from laughing so hysterically. I've lost total control of my body and I'm now scrambling on the floor searching for a chance in between to breathe. That's how funny that was, I'm actually fucking dying. Thanks dude, really funny. How did you even think of that joke? It must've required a lot of thinking from a person with such a high IQ such as yourself. Has anyone told you how hilarious you are? Can you tell that joke again? And again after that and after that and after that and after that and after that and after that and just keep going and going? That's how much I want to hear it. That's just how funny you are.
